# loop-swav.py

(by RoadrunnerWMC)

A tiny little script that just enables the "looped" flag on SWAV audio files, since many converters don't include that option. The loop size is set to the total audio length.

## Usage

Specify any number of SWAV files as command-line arguments, and it will write a looped version of each one to `(filename)-looped.swav`.
